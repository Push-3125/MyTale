# üìñ MyTale ‚Äì AI-powered Story Reading Platform

Mytale is a **web-based platform** that allows users to read, search, and interact with stories.  
The system integrates **AI features** such as summarization, recommendations, and advanced search to provide a **personalized and modern reading experience**.

## 1. Problem Statement

Traditional reading platforms face several issues:
- Limited personalized recommendations.
- Lack of AI features (summarization, translation, chatbot).
- Difficulties for authors in managing stories and reaching readers.
- Scattered story sources, leading to inconsistent quality.

Mytale aims to solve these by creating an **AI-powered centralized platform** for both readers and authors.
